Carol we almost out of here? I've got places to be. 

I'm down for some chinese food tonight, and maybe some bowling. 


This is so amazing. 

Darrin and Jhosep are going to rock this.

Carol Computer

Scooby-Dooby-Doo, Where Are You? 
We got some work to do now. 
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, Where Are You? 
We need some help from you now. 

Come on Scooby-Doo, I see you... pretending you got a sliver 
But you're not fooling me, cause I can see, the way you shake and shiver. 

You know we got a mystery to solve, 
So Scooby Doo be ready for your act. [Scooby Doo] Uh-uh Uh-uh 
Don't hold back! 
And Scooby Doo if you come through 
you're going to have yourself a scooby snack! 
(That's a fact!)

Scooby-Dooby-Doo, here are you. 
You're ready and you're willing. 
If we can count on you Scooby Doo, 
I know we'll catch that villian.

Carol is the best. Bob needs to go home. 

Let's all go home soon, eh?
